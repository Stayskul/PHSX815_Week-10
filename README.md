# PHSX815_Week-10
contains the homework other figures used for week 10


Homework 11 contains code from the following
my own repositories and past homeworks/projects
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-central-limit-theorem/


How to run:
place Random.py into a folder and specify its location in the CentralLim.py file
This updated Random.py file, contains a new function, which "SkewNorm3" which instead of generating one single random number, can generate an array of length Nmeas

Next, in the terminal, simply run: python3 CentralLim.py -sigx a -mux b, where a and b are the average and standard deviation of the lognorm distribution.
